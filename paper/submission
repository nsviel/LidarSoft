Lidium: a 3D point cloud processing software for TLS LiDAR data

v1.0.0

Hello,
This is a software elaborated during my PhD. It's a big piece of work which is more a good basis of work than an industrial product. The documentation and comments of the code is not advanced but will be complete over time.
Best,
NSV
